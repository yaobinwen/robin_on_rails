# LaTex

- The official website seems to be [The LaTex Project](https://www.latex-project.org/).
- [_Comprehensive TeX Archive Network_](https://ctan.org), or "CTAN", provides all kinds of packages for TeX.
- [LaTeX vs. MiKTeX: The levels of TeX](https://www.tug.org/levels.html).
- [PDF: LATEX Math for Undergrads](https://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf): A cheat sheet for many common math symbols.
- I really need beautiful examples of TeX documents:
  - [Showcase of beautiful typography done in TeX & friends](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1319/66282)
  - [TeX User Group: The TeX showcase](https://tug.org/texshowcase/)
  - [Beautiful presentations done with TeX and related systems](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/105621/66282)
