## Manually install a package

1. Download the package from [CTAN](https://ctan.org/). It's usually a `.zip` file.
2. Extract the files from the `.zip` file.
3. If the package doesn't contain the `.sty` file (usually only has the `.ins` and `.dtx` files), then generate the `.sty` file:
  - `latex <filename>.ins`
  - `latex <filename>.dtx`
4. Create the folder `/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex`.
5. Put the package folder (which should contain the `.sty` file now) into `/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex` (so the full path is `/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/<pkg-folder>/<filename>.sty`).
6. `cd /usr/local/share/texmf` and run `sudo mktexlsr` to update the `ls-R` database.
  - This is needed because "`/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/` is not searched recursively by `kpathsea` (cf. `kpsepath tex`), the `ls-R` file at the root directory of this search path must be updated to make the system aware of the new package." ([ref](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/39165/66282))

## ! LaTeX Error: File `filename.sty' not found

Refer to [_! LaTeX Error: File filename .sty not found_](https://github.com/jankapunkt/latexcv/wiki/!-LaTeX-Error:-File--filename-.sty-not-found). Basically, the error means the mentioned `.sty` package is missing as part of the TeXLive distribution, and we need to find the TeXLive package that includes it. The method is as follows:

- `sudo apt update`
- `sudo apt-cache search <filename>`
  - Example: `sudo apt-cache search csquotes`
- It may return some results like below:

```
texlive-latex-extra - TeX Live: LaTeX additional packages
```

- Run `sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra`
