# English: Notes of Learning English

## Overview

I am from China; my mother tongue is Mandarin. I'm always trying to improve my English because I'm currently living in the United States and I need to speak it in Starbucks to buy coffee. So it is very important!

Some people argue that the essential purpose of a language is communication, so it doesn't matter that much when you make a mistake as long as you make yourself understood. I don't entirely agree. Knowing the communication essence encourages one to talk to others, but it doesn't justify the acceptance of misusing the language. My personal experience is that, though the native speakers understand you and tolerate your language mistakes, they may not feel comfortable hearing that. Sometimes, the poor choices of words or incorrect tense can cause misunderstanding between the speaker and the listener, hence hinder the communication.

In contrast, improving your language can help you live a better life. It allows you to enjoy your conversation with others and reading fiction (which can be a big challenge due to the massive vocabulary, and which I'm still struggling with). It minimizes, though not possibly eliminates, the miscommunication, and makes the listeners feel comfortable. All in all, it increases the overall social happiness (Aha, [Jeremy Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham) would then want to make friends with me!).

## Vocabulary Building

- Learn about [Lexile Measure](https://lexile.com/) and use its feature ["Find a Book"](https://fab.lexile.com/).
  - I'm currently trying the book [_A People's History of the United States_](https://fab.lexile.com/book/details/9780061989834/) which has the measure of `1240L`.
- To read English books, use Kindle because it offers word-wise feature.
- Guiding books provide description of precise operations which I can learn and use. The guiding books include:
  - Cooking recipes
  - Repairing guides
  - Appliance user manuals
  - Travel guides
- Read articles or essays about the subjects I'm interested in to build relevant vocabulary.

## Grammar

### Articles

The article [_Articles_](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/articles/) provides a good overview on this topic. Pay more attention to the section _Omission of Articles_. The article [_Geographical Use of the Definite Article, The_](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/geographical-use-the/) talks specifically about the definite article "the".

## Freakonomics Radio

[Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/) is good because it offers a wide range of topics about the society which help you accumulate relevant vocabulary. It also provides transcripts for most of the podcasts so it is good for listening practice. Thirdly, the transcripts have the links to external resources that you can learn about.

| 285 | [There’s a War on Sugar. Is It Justified? (Rebroadcast)](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/sugar-rebroadcast/) | Some people argue that sugar should be regulated, like alcohol and tobacco, on the grounds that it’s addictive and toxic. How much sense does that make? We hear from a regulatory advocate, an evidence-based skeptic, a former F.D.A. commissioner — and the organizers of Milktoberfest. | No | |
