# English Is Hard to Learn

This is not a ranting, but a record of the moments that I found English is hard to learn. Every paragraph starts with "English is hard to learn"...

Here we go.

English is hard to learn. The pronunciation stress starts at the first syllable for the words "anarchy"(/ˈæn·ər·ki, -ˌɑr·ki/), "anarchism"(/ˈæn.ə.kɪ.zəm/), and "anarchist"(/ˈæn.ɚ.kɪst/). All of a sudden, the stress jumps to the second syllable for "anarchic"(/əˈnɑːr.kɪk/).
