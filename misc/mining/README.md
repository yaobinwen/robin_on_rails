Recently I read the paper [3D mine mapping â€“ improving grade control and reconciliation in underground mines using photogrammetric imagery and implicit modelling techniques](http://www.mininggeology.ausimm.com.au/Media/mininggeology/presentations/1610_knight.pdf).

What is the **grade**?

- [What does the grade of a gold mine refer to?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022315/what-does-grade-gold-mine-refer.asp)

> Gold mines and gold deposits are often categorized by the average proportion of gold contained in the ore at the site; this is also known as the ore grade. Higher-quality mines have higher ore grades, and lower-quality mines have lower grades. When gold ore has a high grade, it takes relatively less effort to extract an ounce of gold from the ground; less ore has to be dug out, which reduces input costs for the gold mining company.

What is **grade control**?

[What is grade control and how can it save you time?](https://castledrill.com/what-is-grade-control-drilling/) is a good article that explains three factors to introduce grade control: `economics`, `milling`, and `profitability`. As it is said in `economics` section:

> The grade of the mineral can vary dramatically due to depth. Geologists will use this information to define the economic limits, to ensure there is return on investment when mining the mineral.

So it looks to me that **grade control** does not control the grade of the ore because this is objective and can't be altered. Instead, it controls the work of the mining company to make sure the company works at a profitable level. The `milling` and `profitability` sections continue to explain how grade control saves the company's time and money, thus generates a better investment return.

[This is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9nmFSQpHEk) from [Komatsu](http://www.komatsu.com.au/Pages/Home.aspx) about **vehicle automation for the mining industry** which defines the automation quite well. Basically, their technology uses autonomous driving and allows the operators to operate the vehicles remotely. Interestingly, however, the comments below this video all express their dislike of the autonomous or remote operating idea. They seem to like driving "in the cab".
