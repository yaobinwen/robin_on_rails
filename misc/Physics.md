Here are some notes to help understand the following paragraph (referred to as `Ch02-P01`):

> An equally remarkable consequence of relativity is the way it has revolutionized our ideas of space and time. In Newton's theory, if a pulse of light is sent from one place to another, different observers would agree on the time that the journey took (since time is absolute), but will not always agree on how far the light traveled (since space is not absolute). Since the speed of the light is just the distance it has traveled divided by the time it has taken, different observers would measure different speeds for the light.

In earlier paragraphs, Hawking said "Newton was very worried by this lack of absolute position, or absolute space, as it was called, because it did not accord with his idea of an absolute God." Then the paragraph `Ch02-P01` says "since space is not absolute". Note that Newton's belief of "absolute space" is just his own belief, not a part of his theory. His theory implies that space is not absolute.

Then the book says:

> Both Aristotle and Newton believed in absolute time. That is, they believed that one could unambiguously measure the interval of time between two events, and that this time would be the same whoever measured it, provided they used a good clock.

This is why the paragraph `Ch02-P01` says "different observers would agree on the time that the journey took".

What confused me initially was why "not always agree on how far the light traveled". In fact, Hawking uses the Ping-Pong ball example to explain this. For example, if the starting and ending places in the experiment happens on a moving train as the Ping-Pong ball example does, a person who sits in the train and uses the train as the reference frame will say the light pulse travels, say, 1 meter. In contrast, another person who stands on the platform outside the train will say the light pulse travels 1 meter plus the distance that the train has moved. Therefore, for the first person, the light speed is c, but for the second person, the light speed is c plus v which is the train's velocity.

How to understand the [light cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone)?

The book says (referred to as `Ch02-P02`):

> Similarly, the light spreading out from an event forms a (three-dimensional) cone in the (four-dimensional) space-time. This cone is called the _future light cone of the event__. In the same way we can draw another cone, called the _past light cone_, which is **the set of events from which a pulse of light is able to reach the given event**.

Then follows the paragraphs about three classes of events (referred to as `Ch02-P03`, `Ch02-P04`, and `Ch02-P05`):

> Given an event P, one can divide the other events in the universe into three classes. Those events that can be reached from the event P by a particle or wave traveling at or below the speed of light are said to be _in the future of P_. ... Only events in the future of P can be affected by what happens at P because nothing can travel faster than light.
>
> Similarly, the past of P can be defined as the set of all events from which it is possible to reach the event P traveling at or below the speed of light. It is thus the set of events that can affect what happens at P.
>
> The events that do not lie in the future or past of P are said to be lie in the elsewhere of P. What happens at such events can neither affect nor be affected by what happens at P. For example, if the sun were to cease to shine at this very moment, it would not affect things on earth at the present time because they would be in the elsewhere of the event when the sun went out. We would know about it only after eight minutes, the time it takes light to reach us from the sun. Only then would events on earth lie in the future light cone of the event at which the sun went out. Similarly, we do not know what is happening at the moment farther away in the universe: the light that we see from distant galaxies left them millions of years ago, and in the case of the most distant object that we have seen, the light left some eight thousand million years ago.
