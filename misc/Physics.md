## A Brief History of Time

### Chapter 2: Space and Time

You can find a summary here: [A Brief History of Time | Chapter 2 : Space and Time | Summary](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-Brief-History-of-Time/chapter-2-summary/).

Here are some notes to help understand the following paragraph (referred as `Ch02-P01`):

> An equally remarkable consequence of relativity is the way it has revolutionized our ideas of space and time. In Newton's theory, if a pulse of light is sent from one place to another, different observers would agree on the time that the journey took (since time is absolute), but will not always agree on how far the light traveled (since space is not absolute). Since the speed of the light is just the distance it has traveled divided by the time it has taken, different observers would measure different speeds for the light.

In earlier paragraphs, Hawking said "Newton was very worried by this lack of absolute position, or absolute space, as it was called, because it did not accord with his idea of an absolute God." Then the paragraph `Ch02-P01` says "since space is not absolute". Note that Newton's belief of "absolute space" is just his own belief, not a part of his theory. His theory implies that space is not absolute.

Then the book says:

> Both Aristotle and Newton believed in absolute time. That is, they believed that one could unambiguously measure the interval of time between two events, and that this time would be the same whoever measured it, provided they used a good clock.

This is why the paragraph `Ch02-P01` says "different observers would agree on the time that the journey took".

What confused me initially was why "not always agree on how far the light traveled". In fact, Hawking uses the Ping-Pong ball example to explain this. For example, if the starting and ending places in the experiment happens on a moving train as the Ping-Pong ball example does, a person who sits in the train and uses the train as the reference frame will say the light pulse travels, say, 1 meter. In contrast, another person who stands on the platform outside the train will say the light pulse travels 1 meter plus the distance that the train has moved. Therefore, for the first person, the light speed is c, but for the second person, the light speed is c plus v which is the train's velocity.
