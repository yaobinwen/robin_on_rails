    # The packages that setuptools will manipulate.
    # Usually, this list is maintained manually, but for large packages, calling
    # `find_packages()` (or `find_namespace_packages()`) is the easiest way.
    #
    # NOTE(ywen) >>>
    # `find_packages()` is defined by renaming `PackageFinder.find`:
    # `find_packages = PackageFinder.find`. There is another `find_packages()`
    # that is defined by `def`.
    #
    # `find_namespace_packages()` is the renamed version of
    # `PEP420PackageFinder.find`.
    #
    # `PackageFinder.find()` is a `classmethod` that takes three arguments:
    # - 1). where='.'
    # - 2). exclude=()
    # - 3). include=('*',)
    #
    # The packages are searched under the directory `where`. Per the source
    # code comment: "It should be supplied as a "cross-platform" (i.e.
    # URL-style) path; it will be converted to the appropriate local path
    # syntax"
    #
    # Therefore, it looks like all the packages here will be put into the
    # distribution package.
