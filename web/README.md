## Front-end

### Prologue

I must write a prologue for the front-end development because of its complexity. There are so many technologies, hence terminologies, that people keep talking about but are confusing to the novice developers. Therefore, laying a solid foundation before diving into the what-I-call **`front-end technology hell`** is important as it gives you a clear mind so you won't lose it.

Please excuse me for making mistakes because I'm also learning everything from scratch. I'll keep updating this document to add more information or correct mistakes.

Alrighty. Let's begin.

According to [Wikipedia: Front-end development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development), the front-end development deals with four parts:

- `Hyper Text Markup Language(HTML)`: Describe the content and the arrangement of a web page.
- `Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)`: Describe the visual effect of the web page content defined by HTML.
- `JavaScript`: Implemnet the user interaction of the web page with the user so the web page content, arrange, and visual effect can be dynamically changed as the user interacts with it.
- `WebAssembly`: I didn't know this technology until I read the Wikipedia page. I know nothing about it so can't provide a reasonable summary of my own. Please read the Wikipedia page for more details. I put it here just to make things complete.

Personally (aka "I could be wrong"), I think HTML and CSS are easy to learn. They are just a fixed set of tags that you can look up in the standards ([HTML](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/html#completed) and [CSS](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/css#completed)). The function of each tag is clearly defined. Your task is to learn the existence of a tag that can meet your need.
