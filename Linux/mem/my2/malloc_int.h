  malloc(size_t n)
  Returns a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of at least n bytes, or null
  if no space is available. Additionally, on failure, errno is
  set to ENOMEM on ANSI C systems.

  If n is zero, malloc returns a minumum-sized chunk. (The minimum
  size is 16 bytes on most 32bit systems, and 24 or 32 bytes on 64bit
  systems.)  On most systems, size_t is an unsigned type, so calls
  with negative arguments are interpreted as requests for huge amounts
  of space, which will often fail. The maximum supported value of n
  differs across systems, but is in all cases less than the maximum
  representable value of a size_t.

/*
  realloc(void* p, size_t n)
  Returns a pointer to a chunk of size n that contains the same data
  as does chunk p up to the minimum of (n, p's size) bytes, or null
  if no space is available.

  The returned pointer may or may not be the same as p. The algorithm
  prefers extending p when possible, otherwise it employs the
  equivalent of a malloc-copy-free sequence.

  If p is null, realloc is equivalent to malloc.

  If space is not available, realloc returns null, errno is set (if on
  ANSI) and p is NOT freed.

  if n is for fewer bytes than already held by p, the newly unused
  space is lopped off and freed if possible.  Unless the #define
  REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES is set, realloc with a size argument of
  zero (re)allocates a minimum-sized chunk.

  Large chunks that were internally obtained via mmap will always
  be reallocated using malloc-copy-free sequences unless
  the system supports MREMAP (currently only linux).

  The old unix realloc convention of allowing the last-free'd chunk
  to be used as an argument to realloc is not supported.

  memalign(size_t alignment, size_t n);
  Returns a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of n bytes, aligned
  in accord with the alignment argument.

  The alignment argument should be a power of two. If the argument is
  not a power of two, the nearest greater power is used.
  8-byte alignment is guaranteed by normal malloc calls, so don't
  bother calling memalign with an argument of 8 or less.

  Overreliance on memalign is a sure way to fragment space.
