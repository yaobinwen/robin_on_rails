# Git

## Overview

This folder is all about [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the distributed version control system.

## List

- `concepts.py`: This script creates a graph to show the relations between the git "concepts". By "concepts" I mean the terms defined in the [Git Glossary](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary). Whenever I start to learn a new technology, I find it usually hard to get the big picture of all the concepts of this technology and, more importantly, their relations. The idea is: If I can get the big picture, I can quickly figure out which batch of concepts are the more fundamental ones that other concepts are built upon. I can then start with those fundamental ones and climb up the tree, layer by layer, until I get to the top eventually.
