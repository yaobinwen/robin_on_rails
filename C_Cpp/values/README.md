## Question about "can be moved from" in Stroustrup's article _"New" Value Terminology_

Recently I'm learning about the value categories of the modern C++ and I came across Bjarne Stroustrup's article [_"New" Value Terminlogy_](https://www.stroustrup.com/terminology.pdf) in one of the comments under [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3601602/630364).

I read through Stroustrup's article, but I didn't understand his explanation of "can be moved from" as he talked about the "two independent properties":

> "can be moved from" - i.e. we are allowed to leave to source of a "copy" in some indeterminate, but valid state.
