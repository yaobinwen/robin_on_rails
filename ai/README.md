# Artificial Intellegence

## Overview

This folder has the notes taken from learning artificial intelligence.

AI is divided broadly into three stages: `artificial narrow intelligence` (ANI), `artificial general intelligence` (AGI) and `artificial super intelligence` (ASI). [AIO-5]

I think AI is an issue of multiple dimensions: technology, philosophy, and economics. Technology is all about how we can implement AI; philosophy is all about the morality of AI; economics is all about how AI affects the human society by changing its economical structure.

## Names

- People:
  - [John McCarthy](http://jmc.stanford.edu/index.html): Father of AI who coined the term "Artificial Intelligence".
  - [Supasorn Suwajanakorn](http://www.supasorn.com/): The one who created the AI version of politicians.
  - [Max Tegmark](http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/): An AI expert in MIT, author of [_Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence_](https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598).
  - [Kevin Frans](http://kvfrans.com/), a [TED 2018 speaker](https://ted2018.ted.com/speakers#kevin-frans), a high school student (2018) who developed a method for "training AI agents to solve many tasks at the same time, by learning a hierarchy of smaller strategies." (后生可畏，我是不是应该考虑做点别的事情了……)
- Organizations:
  - [OpenAI](https://blog.openai.com/introducing-openai/): "...make its results public and its patents royalty-free, all to ensure that the scary prospect of computers surpassing human intelligence may not be the dystopia that some people fear."
