# Study Journal

This document records down my study activities for future reflection. The notes, hopefully, can help other busy ones to figure out how to schedule their own time to study linear algebra.

## 2023-03-23 (Thu)

(I was on vacation in Boston so I had a lot of time.)

15:02 ~ 18:30 (3h27m)

1. Review section _1.A_.
2. Work on the section _1.A_ exercises.

## 2023-03-24 (Fri)

(I was on vacation in Boston so I had a lot of time.)

09:56 ~ 13:59 (4h2m)

1. Study section _1.B: Definition of Vector Space_.
2. Work on the section _1.B_ exercises.

## 2023-03-25 (Sat)

09:07 ~ 10:16 (1h8m)

1. Review section _1.B: Definition of Vector Space_.

## 2023-03-27 (Mon)

22:00 ~ 22:45 (45m)

1. Record the review questions for section `1.B`: Definition of Vector Space.
2. Record the notes for section `1.23`: Notation F^S.

## 2023-04-11 (Tue)

08:13 ~ 09:00 (47m)

1. Review section _1.B: Definition of Vector Space_.

## 2023-04-13 (Thu)

08:25 ~ 09:07 (42m)

1. Studied _1.C Subspaces_ and proved _1.33 Example_ as a vector space.

## 2023-04-20 (Thu)

08:00 ~ 08:30 (30m)

1. Studied _1.C Subspaces_.

## 2023-04-22 (Sat)

21:06 ~ 22:14 (1h7m)

1. Studied _1.35 Examples subspaces_ (a) and (b) (and then realized I needed to review more fundamental mathematical knowledge such as the meaning of "continuous real-valued functions" and "differentiable real-valued functions".)
2. When studying the example (b), I realized I didn't fully understand the definition of _1.23 Notation F^S_ so also reviewed that.

## 2023-04-25 (Tue)

07:02 ~ 08:41 (1h39m)

1. I studied the subject _Sums of Subspaces_. When I tried to prove _1.39 Sum of subspaces is the smallest containing subspace_, I went back to the definition of vector spaces to enhance my understanding of the implication of the commutativity and asscociativity on vector spaces.

## 2023-04-26 (Wed)

07:36 ~ 09:03 (1h27m)

1. I caught up with the notes.
2. I worked on the detailed proof of _1.39 Sum of subspaces is the smallest containing subspace_ (because the textbook doesn't show the details).

## 2023-05-16 (Tue)

07:13 ~ 08:00 (47m), 21:15 ~ 21:55 (40m)

1. After not studying linear algebra for almost 3 weeks, I reviewed the concept of sums of subsets and direct sums.
2. Made notes.

## 2023-05-17 (Wed)

08:30 ~ 09:19 (48m)

1. Studied direct sum.

## 2023-05-18 (Thu)

07:43 ~ 08:52 (1h8m)

1. Studied direct sum.

## 2023-05-19 (Fri)

11:00 ~ 13:07 (2h7m)

1. Made notes about direct sum.

## 2023-05-21 (Sun)

20:43 ~ 21:35 (51m)

1. Studied Section 2.A: _Linear Combinations and Span_.

## 2023-05-26 (Fri)

14:22 ~ 15:36 (1h13m)

1. Studied the sections from 2.10 finite-dimensional vector space to 2.15 infinite-dimensional vector space. But I still need to do more exercises to solidify my understanding.

## 2023-06-03 (Sat)

12:51 ~ 13:41 (50m), 15:57 ~ 17:40 (1h42m)

1. Looked back at Chapter 1 to figure out the relations among the key concepts. I also worked out the initial draft of `Relations.dot` to visualize the relations among the key concepts.

## 2023-06-04 (Sun)

08:00 ~ 10:00 (2h), 11:30 ~ 13:35 (2h5m)

1. Rewrote the notes for Chapter 1. Previously, the topics were all arranged in a linear structure so it was difficult to see how they are related. Now I grouped related topics into the same sections to make the notes easier to grasp the key points.

## 2023-06-05 (Mon)

21:52 ~ 22:45 (53m)

1. Worked on Exercises 1.A to refresh my memory on Chapter 1A.

## 2023-06-18 (Sun)

- 08:50 ~ 09:50 (1h)
- 11:00 ~ 11:30 (30m)

1. Worked on Exercises 1.A to refresh my memory on Chapter 1A. I finished questions 12 ~ 16.
