# Study Journal

This document records down my study activities for future reflection. The notes, hopefully, can help other busy ones to figure out how to schedule their own time to study linear algebra.

## 2023-03-23 (Thu)

(I was on vacation in Boston so I had a lot of time.)

15:02 ~ 18:30 (3h27m)

1. Review section _1.A_.
2. Work on the section _1.A_ exercises.

## 2023-03-24 (Fri)

(I was on vacation in Boston so I had a lot of time.)

09:56 ~ 13:59 (4h2m)

1. Study section _1.B: Definition of Vector Space_.
2. Work on the section _1.B_ exercises.

## 2023-03-25 (Sat)

09:07 ~ 10:16 (1h8m)

1. Review section _1.B: Definition of Vector Space_.

## 2023-03-27 (Mon)

22:00 ~ 22:45 (45m)

1. Record the review questions for section `1.B`: Definition of Vector Space.
2. Record the notes for section `1.23`: Notation F^S.

## 2023-04-11 (Tue)

08:13 ~ 09:00 (47m)

1. Review section _1.B: Definition of Vector Space_.

## 2023-04-13 (Thu)

08:25 ~ 09:07 (42m)

1. Studied _1.C Subspaces_ and proved _1.33 Example_ as a vector space.

## 2023-04-20 (Thu)

08:00 ~ 08:30 (30m)

1. Studied _1.C Subspaces_.

## 2023-04-22 (Sat)

21:06 ~ 22:14 (1h7m)

1. Studied _1.35 Examples subspaces_ (a) and (b) (and then realized I needed to review more fundamental mathematical knowledge such as the meaning of "continuous real-valued functions" and "differentiable real-valued functions".)
2. When studying the example (b), I realized I didn't fully understand the definition of _1.23 Notation F^S_ so also reviewed that.
