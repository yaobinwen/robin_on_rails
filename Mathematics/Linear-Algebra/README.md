# Linear Algebra

## History

See my blog [_Why do we study matrices in linear algebra?_](https://yaobinwen.github.io/2022/04/06/Why-study-matrices-in-linear-algebra.html) which also has a list of articles about the history. The folder `History` also has the PDF documents in case they get lost one day. Note that the original authors own the copyright and the documents should not be used for any commercial purposes unless permitted by the authors.

## Review Document

The PDF document [_Linear Algebra Review and Reference_](./Linear-Algebra-Review-and-Reference.pdf) is downloaded from [this link](https://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) which is a material in the course [_CS229: Machine Learning_](https://cs229.stanford.edu/).
