# Robin on Rails: My Knowledge Base, and Me

## Overview

Primarily, `Robin on Rails` is my knowledge base that I throw notes and thoughts in.

Secondarily, it's also about me.

I tried to build my site on some other platforms. Eventually, I came back to a regular GitHub repository. After all, I am a software developer.

## Folders

I put every topic I'm interested in into a folder, and I put a `README.md` file under every of them. I'll briefly describe what each folder is all about. You can click that folder and GitHub will nicely and automatically show the details in its README file.

- `git`: Knowledge about Git.
- `linux`: Knowledge about Linux.
- `mining`: Knowledge about the mining industry ([2018/03/31] My current employer serves the mining industry so I want to learn about this domain.)
