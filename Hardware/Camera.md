## Calibration

What are a camera's "extrinsic calibration" and "intrinsic calibration"?

---

Extrinsic calibration and intrinsic calibration are two important concepts in the field of computer vision and photogrammetry that are related to the calibration of cameras.

Intrinsic calibration refers to the process of determining the internal characteristics of a camera that are specific to the individual camera, such as the focal length, the principal point, and the distortion parameters. These parameters are typically used to correct for lens distortion and project the 3D world onto the 2D image plane of the camera. Intrinsic calibration is typically performed by taking images of a known calibration target, such as a checkerboard pattern, from different angles and orientations.

Extrinsic calibration, on the other hand, refers to the process of determining the position and orientation of the camera with respect to the 3D world. This involves determining the camera's translation and rotation in space, which are necessary for converting the 2D image measurements into 3D coordinates. Extrinsic calibration is typically performed by using a set of control points with known 3D coordinates, and taking images of these points from different camera positions.

In summary, intrinsic calibration determines the internal characteristics of the camera, while extrinsic calibration determines the position and orientation of the camera with respect to the 3D world. Both types of calibration are important for accurate 3D reconstruction and computer vision tasks.

## Factors that affect image file size

The size of a picture taken with a camera can be affected by a number of factors, even if the resolution and ROI remain the same. Here are some factors that can affect the size of a picture:

    Image format: The file format of the image can have a big impact on its size. For example, a JPEG file is typically smaller than a PNG file at the same resolution, due to differences in the way they compress the image data.

    Compression level: When saving an image in a compressed format like JPEG, the compression level can be adjusted to balance image quality and file size. Higher compression levels can result in smaller file sizes, but at the cost of reduced image quality.

    Color depth: The number of bits used to represent each color in the image, or color depth, can affect the file size. A higher color depth means more information is stored for each pixel, resulting in a larger file size.

    Image content: The content of the image can also affect its size, even when the resolution and ROI are the same. For example, an image with a lot of detail or fine texture will generally be larger than an image with a more uniform or simple background.

    Sensor size: The size of the camera sensor can also affect the size of the resulting image, even when the resolution and ROI are the same. A larger sensor can capture more detail, resulting in a larger image file.

Overall, there are many factors that can affect the size of a picture, even when the resolution and ROI remain the same. Understanding these factors can help you optimize your image capture and processing workflows to achieve the desired balance between image quality and file size.

---

In addition to those you mentioned above, could you list more possible factors?

---

Sure, here are some additional factors that can affect the size of a picture, even when the resolution and ROI are the same:

    Aspect ratio: The aspect ratio of the image can affect its size, as images with a wider aspect ratio may require more pixels to achieve the same resolution as an image with a more square aspect ratio.

    Noise reduction: Some cameras apply noise reduction algorithms to images as they are captured, which can result in larger file sizes.

    Exposure time: Longer exposure times can result in larger file sizes, as more data is captured for each pixel in the image.

    White balance: Adjusting the white balance of an image can affect its size, as different white balance settings may require more or fewer bits to represent each color in the image.

    Lens quality: The quality of the camera lens can affect the sharpness and clarity of the image, which can impact its file size.

    Metadata: Information such as the camera model, date and time of capture, and GPS location can be stored as metadata in the image file, which can increase its size.

These are just a few examples of additional factors that can affect the size of a picture. It's worth noting that the impact of these factors on file size can vary depending on the specific camera and image processing settings being used.

I want to explore the "image content", "exposure time", and "white balance" a bit more. Suppose that I have a particular camera (so the hardware specification is well defined) and I have configured it to use a specific image format, compression level, sensor size, aspect ratio. I also configured the camera to adjust the exposure time and white balance automatically according to the external environment. Now, what factors in the external environment can affect the result picture size?

Even with a well-defined camera and fixed image processing settings, there are still several external factors that can affect the resulting image size when the camera is configured to adjust exposure time and white balance automatically. Here are some examples:

    Lighting conditions: The amount and type of light in the scene can have a significant impact on the exposure time and white balance settings used by the camera. For example, a scene with low light levels may require a longer exposure time, resulting in a larger image file.

    Color temperature: The color temperature of the light in the scene can affect the white balance setting used by the camera. For example, indoor lighting may have a warmer color temperature than daylight, which can result in a different white balance setting and potentially a different file size.

    Dynamic range: The dynamic range of the scene, or the range of brightness values from the darkest to brightest areas, can affect the exposure time and white balance settings used by the camera. Scenes with a high dynamic range may require longer exposure times and more complex white balance adjustments, resulting in larger file sizes.

    Subject matter: The content of the image can also affect the resulting file size, even with the same exposure time and white balance settings. For example, images with a lot of detail or fine texture may result in larger files than images with a more uniform or simple background.

    Camera movement: If the camera is moving during the exposure, this can result in motion blur or other distortions that can affect the resulting image size. This can be especially pronounced in low light conditions, where longer exposure times are required.

    Reflections and glare: If there are reflective surfaces or glare in the scene, this can affect the exposure time and white balance settings used by the camera, potentially resulting in larger files.

These are just a few examples of external factors that can affect the resulting image size when the camera is configured to adjust exposure time and white balance automatically. It's worth noting that the specific impact of these factors on file size can vary depending on the camera and image processing settings being used.

You said "just a few examples." Could you list more other factors from the external environment?

---

Sure, here are some additional factors from the external environment that can affect the resulting image size:

    Temperature: Extreme temperatures can affect the performance of the camera's sensor and electronics, which can impact the image quality and potentially the resulting file size.

    Humidity: High humidity can cause fogging on the lens or sensor, which can result in a loss of image quality and potentially larger files.

    Altitude: At high altitudes, the lower atmospheric pressure can affect the camera's performance and potentially impact image quality and file size.

    Wind: Wind can cause camera shake or movement, which can result in blurry images or other distortions that can impact file size.

    Dust and debris: If there is dust or debris on the lens or sensor, this can result in a loss of image quality and potentially larger files.

    Distance to subject: The distance between the camera and the subject can affect the exposure time and potentially the resulting file size. For example, images taken from a distance may require longer exposure times or may be more likely to be affected by atmospheric haze.

    Camera angle: The angle at which the camera is pointed can affect the exposure time and potentially the resulting file size. For example, images taken at an angle towards the sun may require shorter exposure times or may be more likely to be affected by lens flare.

These are just a few additional examples of external factors that can affect the resulting image size. It's worth noting that the specific impact of these factors on file size can vary depending on the camera and image processing settings being used.

Wow these are all good food for thought. Could you list all the factors from the external environment that you are aware of? I want to see an exhausting list of them.

It's worth noting that not all of these factors may affect the resulting image size in all cases, and the specific impact of each factor can vary depending on the camera and image processing settings being used. Nonetheless, it's important to be aware of these factors and how they may affect the quality and size of your images, in order to optimize your image capture and processing workflows.
