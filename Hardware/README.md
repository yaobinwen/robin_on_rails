# Hardware

## Overview

In the _Hardware_ section, I want to study the following subjects:

- The computer architecture. Refer to the books such as [_Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface_](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-MIPS-Architecture-dp-0128201096/dp/0128201096) and [_Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach_](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Architecture-Quantitative-Approach-Kaufmann/dp/0128119055).
- The software development on the CPUs, such as [_IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals_](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html)
- Understanding of various types of hardware.
