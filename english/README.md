# English: Notes of Learning English

## Overview

I am from China; my mother tongue is Mandarin. I'm always trying to improve my English because I'm currently living in the United States and I need to speak it in Starbucks to buy coffee. So it is very important!

Some people argue that the essential purpose of a language is communication, so it doesn't matter that much when you make a mistake as long as you make yourself understood. I don't entirely agree. Knowing the communication essence encourages one to talk to others, but it doesn't justify the acceptance of misusing the language. My personal experience is that, though the native speakers understand you and tolerate your language mistakes, they may not feel comfortable hearing that. Sometimes, the poor choices of words or incorrect tense can cause misunderstanding between the speaker and the listener, hence hinder the communication.

In contrast, improving your language can help you live a better life. It allows you to enjoy your conversation with others and reading fiction (which can be a big challenge due to the massive vocabulary, and which I'm still struggling with). It minimizes, though not possibly eliminates, the miscommunication, and makes the listeners feel comfortable. All in all, it increases the overall social happiness (Aha, [Jeremy Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham) would then want to make friends with me!).
