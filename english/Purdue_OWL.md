# Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL)

I find [Purdue OWL](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/) a very excellent web site to learn academic writing. Influenced by my native language, I must have made a lot of writing mistakes without consciousness. I list my notes of reading the materials as follows.

## Punctuation

---

> Use a comma between coordinate adjectives (adjectives that are equal and reversible).
>
> - The sturdy, compact suitcase made a perfect gift.

- Q: What if there are more than two adjectives before the subject? Should I use ", and ..." before the last adjective?

---

Pay attention to the use of commas in the following example:

> "Yes," she promised. Todd replied, saying, "I will be back this afternoon."

- The comma is put before the enclosing quotation mark as in `"Yes,"`.
- After the verb like "say" or "reply", a comma is used before the quoted words, not a semicolon. This is different from Chinese.

A **semicolon** can be used to join two **independent** clauses, but these two clauses must have some inner connection. For example:

> Road construction in Dallas has hindered travel around town; streets have become covered with bulldozers, trucks, and cones.

In this example, the two clauses are both talking about the road construction, which is their inner connection.

If the two sentences are not related at all, one should not join them with a semicolon. For (a bad) example:

> Tom is 10 years old; the cat has very soft fur.

These two clauses are talking about unrelated topics and should not use semicolon. Use a period to separate them.

---

OWL gives another example:

> Terrorism in the United States has become a recent concern; in fact, the concern for America's safety has led to an awareness of global terrorism.

In fact, one can also use a period to separate these two sentences. However, the semicolon creates a shorter pause than the period counterpart, and their video [Purdue OWL: 90-Second Semicolon Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8uQESW76to) says:

> Shorter pause draws attention to the connection.

Therefore, the semicolon reflects the writer thinks these two parts are more closely related than when using a period. I think this is kind of subjective to the writer's judgment.

---

I learned a new rule:

> Use a semicolon to join elements of a series when individual items of the series already include commas.
>
> - Recent sites of the Olympic Games include Athens, Greece; Salt Lake City, Utah; Sydney, Australia; Nagano, Japan.

When two independent clauses are joined by a colon, the first word of the second clause should not be initial-capitalized. This is something that Chinese doesn't have because we don't need to handle capitalization.

> Road construction in Dallas has hindered travel around town: parts of Main, Fifth, and West Street are closed during the construction.

---

> Use a colon after an independent clause when it is followed by a list, a quotation, an appositive, or other ideas directly related to the independent clause.
> 
> - Julie went to the store for some groceries: milk, bread, coffee, and cheese.
> - I know the perfect job for her: a politician.
> - In his Gettysburg Address, Abraham Lincoln urges Americans to rededicate themselves to the unfinished work of the deceased soldiers: "It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth."

Note that, in the first two examples, the words after the colons are not initial-capitalized.

The third example is worthy of attention because it requires a colon be used, not a comma. I think it is due to two reasons. Firstly, the quoted words, although they were put out by the speaker in an oral way, are more like a normal quotation rather than a "saying" process. Secondly, the use of "urge" emphasizes the purpose of the speech, not the "saying" process itself.

It's sort of hard to understand how a dash should be used precisely. What I can do so far is learn the given examples and **"feel"** if it is appropriate to use it in my situation:

> - Perhaps one reason why the term has been so problematic—so resistant to definition, and yet so transitory in those definitions—is because of its multitude of applications.
> - In terms of public legitimacy—that is, in terms of garnering support from state legislators, parents, donors, and university administrators—English departments are primarily places where advanced literacy is taught.
> - The U.S.S. Constitution became known as "Old Ironsides" during the War of 1812—during which the cannonballs fired from the British H.M.S. Guerriere merely bounced off the sides of the Constitution.
> - To some of you, my proposals may seem radical—even revolutionary.

It looks like the elements after a dash are never complete sentences but phrases to provide additional information, and in which colons are not applicable and commas would divide the whole sentence into too small pieces for the readers to put them back together.

When using quotation marks:

- commas and periods are placed inside the closing quotation mark;
- colons and semicolons are placed outside;
- the placement of question and exclamation marks depends on the situation.

For example:

> - He asked, "When will you be arriving?" I answered, "Sometime after 6:30."
> - History is stained with blood spilled in the name of "justice."
> - "Self-Reliance," by Ralph Waldo Emerson
> - "Just Like a Woman," by Bob Dylan
> - "The Smelly Car," an episode of Seinfeld
