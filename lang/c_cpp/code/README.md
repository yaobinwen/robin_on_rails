# C/C++ Code

## Overview

This directory has some programs written in C/C++ for different learning purposes. See the list below for details. This directory also contains the code that can be shared among different programs so I don't have to create the wheels repeatedly.

The `programs` directory has all the executables, aka the `main` entries. The other directories, unless specified otherwise, have the code of reusable modules.

## How to Build

Install `cmake` (>= 3.10) and follow the steps below:

- `mkdir bin`
- `cd bin`
- `cmake ..`
- `cmake --build .`
