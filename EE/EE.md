# Electronics Devices and Circuits

(I referred to [Physics and Radio Electronics: Electronics devices and circuits](https://www.physics-and-radio-electronics.com/electronic-devices-and-circuits.html) when I studied the related topics. Many thanks to the site author!)

## 1. Overview

The notes in this document does not mean to teach physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering. Instead, I use them to quickly refresh my memory of the related topics, so the things that I have learned and understood (back in middle school) are not recorded here.

The notes start with atomic physics which is fundamental to understand electronics devices and circuits.

## 2. Atoms

An atom consists of three particles:

| Particle | Charge |
|---------:|:-------|
| electron | negative (-) |
| proton | positive (+) |
| neutron | neutral |

Protons and neutrons are bound together by the [strong nuclear force](https://www.physics-and-radio-electronics.com/physics/natural-forces/strong-nuclear-force.html) and form **nucleus**.

### 2.1 Electrons

An atom may have multiple electrons. The electrons revolve around the nucleus in different orbits.

The electrons on the same orbit have the same amount of energy. Electrons on different orbits have different amounts of energy.

### 2.2 Mass number

Compared to protons and neutrons, an electron's mass is about 1830 times smaller, hence negligible.

| Term | Symbol | Description |
|-----:|:-------|:------------|
| Atomic number | `Z` | The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. |
| Neutron number | `N` | The number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. |
| Mass number | `A` (= Z + N) | The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. |
