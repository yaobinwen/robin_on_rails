# Chapter 07: Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- Role and user definitions: the "subjects"
- Objects
- Activities/actions
- Subject-Objet-Activity matrix
- Use cases
- Abuse cases (inside and outside adversaries)
  - [SAFECode: Practical Security Stories and Security Tasks for Agile Development Environments](https://safecode.org/publication/SAFECode_Agile_Dev_Security0712.pdf)
- Sequencing and timing: time of check / time of use (TOC/TOU) attack
  - Race conditions -> race window
    - The "race window" is a period of opportunity when concurrent threads can compete in attempting to alter the same object.
  - Infinite loop
- Secure Coding Standards
  - (Page 138) To prevent error conditions from cascading or propagating through a system, each function should practice complete error mitigation, including error trapping and complete handling, before returning to the calling routine.
  - SEI/CERT secure coding standards:
    - [C](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standard)
    - [C++](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=88046682)
    - [Java](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEI+CERT+Oracle+Coding+Standard+for+Java)
    - [Perl](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/perl/SEI+CERT+Perl+Coding+Standard)
    - [Android](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/android/Android+Secure+Coding+Standard)

## Operational Requirements

- Deployment environment should be secured, too.

## Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

The requirements traceability matrix (RTM) is a grid that assists the development team in tracking and managing requirements and implementation details. It acts as a management tool and documentation system.

## Summary

A complete SDLC solution ensures systems are secure by design, secure by default, and secure in deployment.
