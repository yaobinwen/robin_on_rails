# OAuth 2.0 Demo

## Overview

This folder has a server and a client to demonstrate how OAuth 2.0 works. They can both run on the localhost.

**NOTE**: Because the server is implemented with Python 3's `http.server` module which only "implements basic security checks", use the code for learning purpose only and not for any production. See [the warning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html).
