# The Lawrence Berkeley Lab (LBL) Hack

I first learned about the Lawrence Berkeley Lab (LBL) hack when listening to [this episode on the Malicious Life show](https://malicious.life/episode/episode-210/). It is a fascinating story. I collected some more articles or documents about this event:

  - The slides in PDF can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20171215165326/www.taosecurity.com/bejtlich_doj_cooking_06feb11a.pdf). I also saved a copy in this folder.
