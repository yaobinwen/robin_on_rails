- How to set up the Swarm mode:
  - This post ([Jenkins Slave Nodes â€“ using the Swarm Plugin](http://www.donaldsimpson.co.uk/2013/03/18/jenkins-slave-nodes-using-the-swarm-plugin/)) describes the process to set up both the master and the slave nodes.
  - [This answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34078581/630364) mentions the use of `username` and `password` to connect the slave to the master. Note the `username` and `password` are one of the Jenkins accounts.
  - [This email](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-users/bQLIJwoVPzU/ifsgQKVu0GIJ) shows how to configure the master side: under "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure Global Security" -> "Agent" -> Enabled the "TCP port for JNLP slave agents" to "Random" (or a fixed one if appropriate).
