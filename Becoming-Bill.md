# Becoming Bill

This is a conversation between me and Bill on Oct. 2nd, 2021.

Me:

> Hi Bill, what is your secret of keeping up with the technologies?
>
> You told me that you've been reading a lot of tech books. I can see that because you've taken many of them to the office. But I guess maybe you also work on side projects? If you do, how do you come up with the ideas of these side projects?
>
> One thing that has amazed me a lot is your range of knowledge. I feel you can work on things from hardware, OS kernel, and all the way up to the frontend. How did you do that?
>
> Another thing is the speed you learn new things. I remember you said you didn't have much experience in Ansible before, but I feel you can quickly pick up the technology and become quite familiar with that and, usually, you can find the “best practices” for that technology. I'm always wondering how you achieve this. I believe you must have done a lot of reading to learn the new technology, but other than that, do you also attend online seminars or offline meet-ups? Or maybe do you have a group of friends that know the related technologies?
>
> I guess you are also a frequent reader of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) because I remember you forwarded posts from there.

> So I have also tried to do something that I hope could help me accelerate my learning. For example, I tried to read source code of the tools that we use in order to better understand a problem (e.g., `ansible`, `dpkg` tools, Python). I also tried to read Hacker News whenever I get a chance to learn what's happening in the tech community. I also joined a few IRC channels (e.g., `ansible`) or email groups (e.g., reproducible build) to see what other developers are talking about on the topics. But, honestly speaking, I feel I'm not making as much progress as I expect.
>
> So I wanna learn more about how you are doing things.

Bill:

> Thank you for all the compliments Yaobin. That is really nice of you!
>
> I am going to think about this more and hopefully give you a more complete answer later. I think it would be really useful to be able to talk about good ways to learn new material and broaden your interests with people. It's not something I'm good at explaining yet, unfortunately.
>
> The advice I can give you right now:
>
> 1) Always stay curious. Always keep reading. Don't let something pass by your attention if you don't understand some part of it. Chase that thing down and learn about it. When people don't understand something (or at least when I don't), we tend to skip over it and not think about it too much. The right thing to do is to remember that you didn't understand that part, and go back and study it after you've gotten through the main communication. This way you will (eventually) learn about a lot more topics than you would have known about otherwise.
>
> 2) Don't mentally box yourself in. Don't say, I am a programmer, I can't do X. I've only learned A, B, C in school, I'm not one of those people who can learn D. Just go look at D and see if it interests you, or could be useful to you.
>
> 3) Think about the **relationships** between all the things you know as much as you possibly can. There are a lot of patterns in software engineering, and honestly in every part of life I know about, that are analogous between different parts of the field or different parts of life entirely. Nobody talks about these or writes about them (as far as I know). It seems like each individual has to find them for themselves, for the specific knowledge they have in their life.
>
> This is a way I speed up learning new things: If it's similar to something I've already learned, I try to see the similar structure between them. It's not exactly learning by analogy, because analogies don't even work. But if I can get somewhere with analogies I try that way too. Basically, make yourself understand it any way you can possibly figure out to get the knowledge to truly be a part of yourself.
>
> 4) Very important! Don't worry about how much progress you are making. Everyone feels this way. I am frustrated all the time at how slowly I am going. If you let this emotion capture your attention, you will be diverted from learning more. I would say (and I need this advice too), just accept that you haven't learned thing X as well as you'd like. Keep trying to learn it, and also make sure that you know what your goal is in learning it. A lot of times when you are not making as much progress as you'd like, it's simply because you want to have mastered the subject already, and you haven't. Didn't master it = slow. I also don't like it when this happens to me but hey, we are only human :slightly_smiling_face:
>
> 5) Whatever you are doing, be 100% present to that activity and those people. Put yourself completely into it and don't hold back.
>
> I hope this is helpful to you! Let me know if you want to talk about learning/studying again in the future, I am always glad to think about it and talk about it.

Me:

> Hi Bill, thanks for the information and the advice!
>
> I'm not sure if the English word "compliment" has the connotation of "being dishonest because the speaker just wants to say something nice to make the other person feel good". Its English explanation doesn't suggest so, but when I learned this word back in high school in China, its Chinese translation does have such a connotation. But if this is also true for its English meaning, then, no, what I said earlier were not just compliments. I know more software developers back in China than in the US, but as far as I see, almost all of them are just good at in one particular area (or maybe two). For a long time, I thought that was true for everyone: focus on one area and do it really well (which sounds like the Unix philosophy?), until I saw you. What I have seen on you makes me think there might be a second option and I even invented a term for that: "super-stack developer" because "full-stack" is already not full enough.
>
> And almost the same time I could see the benefit of working this way, which I think is well explained in your point 2): You don't constrain yourself in just one place. This makes you a true team player because you can show up anywhere as long as team need you.
>
> And I'm glad that I have a total buy-in of your points 1) and 2). For a long time, I thought workarounds are acceptable solutions to technical problems. But now I have realized that most of them are the indicators for further learning or a problem elsewhere (e.g., poor design, or a bug in another component). And, as I said above, your presence also broke my mental box of 2). In fact, I told Bryan when he and I had the first one-to-one meeting when he just joined MVS that I want to follow up your path and become a second you. That's also why earlier when you asked me whether I would be OK to work on a particular part of the entire system (even if I had not worked on too much before) and I would be willing to do that. I also want to break the mental box.
>
> Your point 3) and 4) are very helpful, especially the sentence "Nobody talks about these or writes about them (as far as I know)". I just realize I seem to assume "if someone knows something, he/she must have learned from some other material", so I seem to have spent too much time looking for that "material" rather than trying to figure them out by myself. That should be a thing I need to improve.
>
> Honestly speaking, I'm not sure if I fully understand point 5) and the part "broaden your interests with people" in your earlier message. What does "100% present" mean? And by "broaden interests with people" did you mean "have more attention to other people rather than code or machine"?

Bill:

> 1) "Compliment" does not have any negative association in English. It just means to say a positive thing about a person, and to mean it. There is always some other word added to the word "compliment" it if the speaker means to qualify it to mean "just saying something nice to make a person feel good" or "saying something nice to get a person to do something for you" etc. Just the plain word "compliment" is purely positive. (So what I mean is, thank you!)
>
> 2) "Broaden interests" is just rephrasing the idea of not boxing yourself in. If you find yourself curious about something, spend at least a little bit of time investigating it. I definitely did not mean that there is any need to pay less attention to code/machine and more to people. (Although thinking about people is good too, but only if you want to/are interested in it.)
>
> 3) 100% present is talking about how you focus your attention and energy. In some way this is really fundamental but in order of learning to do things, it is secondary or tertiary. Definitely focus on 1-4) first before you worry about this!

Me:

> I see. Thank you for all the advice! Really appreciate them!
