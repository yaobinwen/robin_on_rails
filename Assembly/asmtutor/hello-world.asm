_start:

    mov     eax, ebx        ; move the address in EBX into EAX as well (Both now point to the same segment in memory)
 
nextchar:
    ; NOTE(ywen):
    ; - `[]` dereferences the address to fetch the content.
    ; - `byte` specifies the width of the content to fetch (i.e., in the size of a byte).
    cmp     byte [eax], 0   ; compare the byte pointed to by EAX at this address against zero (Zero is an end of string delimiter)
    jz      finished        ; jump (if the zero flagged has been set) to the point in the code labeled 'finished'
    inc     eax             ; increment the address in EAX by one byte (if the zero flagged has NOT been set)

finished:
    sub     eax, ebx        ; subtract the address in EBX from the address in EAX
                            ; remember both registers started pointing to the same address (see line 15)
                            ; but EAX has been incremented one byte for each character in the message string
                            ; when you subtract one memory address from another of the same type
                            ; the result is number of segments between them - in this case the number of bytes
