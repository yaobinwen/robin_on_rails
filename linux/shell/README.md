## Cheatsheets

- [Bash scripting cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/bash) (Note this cheatsheet may contain Bashism.)
- [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/) is a helpful online utility to analyze the command line and provide links to the corresponding manual.

## Notes

Shell has the concept of "fake signals" which are not generated by the Linux system but by the shell itself. In bash, the fake signals include `EXIT`, `ERR`, `DEBUG`, and `RETURN`(See [2] Chapter 9 - _Fake Signals_). Ohter shell variants may have different fake signals.

The fake signals can be used in `trap`(See [1] - _Shell & Utilities_ - _Shell Command Language_ - _Special Built-in Utilities_ - _trap_).
