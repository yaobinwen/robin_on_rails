# Linux: Knowledge about the Linux OS

[Revolution OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vW62KqKJ5A) is a good documentary that "traces the history of GNU, Linux, open source, and the free software movement." Interestingly, [the official website](http://www.revolution-os.com/index.html) doesn't mention the YouTube link at all, but the YouTube video seemed to be uploaded by the official staff.
