# Encoding

- [Unicode HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html) is a good introductory article about Unicode and encoding even though it is written for the Python programmers.
- [Unicode In Python, Completely Demystified](http://farmdev.com/talks/unicode/) looks like another quite good source.
