# Encoding

- [Unicode HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html) is a good introductory article about Unicode and encoding even though it is written for the Python programmers.
- [Unicode In Python, Completely Demystified](http://farmdev.com/talks/unicode/) looks like another quite good source.
- [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)
